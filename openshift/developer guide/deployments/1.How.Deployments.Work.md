# How Deployments Work

## What Is a Deployment(什么是Deployment)

OKD deployments provide fine-grained management over common user applications. They are described using three separate API objects:

OKD部署提供对常见用户应用程序的细粒度管理。 它们使用三个独立的API对象进行描述：
```

* A deployment configuration, which describes the desired state of a particular component of the application as a pod template.

* One or more replication controllers, which contain a point-in-time record of the state of a deployment configuration as a pod template.

* One or more pods, which represent an instance of a particular version of an application.

部署配置，它将应用程序的特定组件的所需状态描述为pod模板。

一个或多个复制控制器，其中包含作为pod模板的部署配置状态的时间点记录。

一个或多个pod，表示特定版本的应用程序的实例。
```

Users do not need to manipulate replication controllers or pods owned by deployment configurations. The deployment system ensures changes to deployment configurations are propagated appropriately. If the existing deployment strategies are not suited for your use case and you have the need to run manual steps during the lifecycle of your deployment, then you should consider creating a custom strategy.

用户无需操作部署配置所拥有的复制控制器或Pod。 部署系统确保适当地传播对部署配置的更改。 如果现有部署策略不适合您的用例，并且您需要在部署的生命周期中运行手动步骤，那么您应该考虑创建自定义策略。
```

When you create a deployment configuration, a replication controller is created representing the deployment configuration’s pod template. If the deployment configuration changes, a new replication controller is created with the latest pod template, and a deployment process runs to scale down the old replication controller and scale up the new replication controller.
